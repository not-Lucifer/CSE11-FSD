  <h2>Text Styling Experiment</h2>

  <p>
    This is a paragraph created to experiment with different CSS text properties. 
    Notice how the first line is indented, the text is justified, and the line 
    spacing is increased for better readability. Word spacing adds more distance 
    between words, making the paragraph feel airy and clear.
